New features I want:

Currency selection

Add a currency selector in the UI (for example, a dropdown in the header or near “Total Capital”).

Support at least: GBP (£), USD ($), EUR (€), IDR (Rp).

Store the selected currency in state (or a global config) so it’s remembered across the dashboard.

Make all money values (total capital, asset allocation, expenses, recent activity, health score card, etc.) display using the selected currency symbol and correct formatting.

Keep existing numeric logic (amounts and calculations) the same; only change how values are displayed.

Multiple bank accounts

Replace the assumption of a single “total capital” source with a list of bank accounts.

Create a data structure like accounts = [{ id, name, type, balance, currency }].

Add UI to:

View all accounts in a small panel or list (e.g. a card on the dashboard or a new “Accounts” section in the sidebar).

Add a new account (name, type, balance, currency) via a simple form or modal.

Optionally edit or delete an account.

Make “Total Capital” become the sum of all account balances converted into the selected display currency (you can stub a simple conversion function or assume same currency for now; tell me which approach you used).

Ensure expenses, asset allocation, and other cards still work; if they depend on balances, update them to use the accounts data.

Constraints:

Do not remove any existing screens or major components.

Keep the current visual style (cards, gradients, sidebar) as close as possible.

Make changes incrementally rather than rewriting the whole app.

What I want from you:

Inspect the current code and describe where the dashboard data and money values are defined.

Propose a file-by-file plan to add currency selection and multiple accounts.

Show the exact code changes as patches or full snippets for each file.

Provide a short test checklist so I can verify currency switching and account management works.

Start by explaining your understanding and plan, then wait for my confirmation before applying the edits.
